# Calendar Sync AI Agent 🤖📅

An AI-powered chatbot that helps therapists sync their Google Calendar with TherapyAppointment using browser automation, automatically blocking out busy times so clients can't double-book.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Since TherapyAppointment doesn't offer a public API, this agent uses **Playwright browser automation** to interact with the web interface. This is a real-world solution that demonstrates:
- Agentic AI decision-making
- Natural language interaction with LLMs
- Browser automation for platforms without APIs
- Multi-system integration

## Features

- 💬 **Natural Language Interface** - Chat with the AI to sync calendars
- 🔄 **Automated Syncing** - Blocks TherapyAppointment times based on Google Calendar events
- 🌐 **Browser Automation** - Uses Playwright to control TherapyAppointment web interface
- 📊 **Event Viewing** - Ask about upcoming appointments
- 🧠 **LLM-Powered** - Uses Ollama with function calling for intelligent interactions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Ollama installed
- TherapyAppointment account
- Google Calendar

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calendar-sync-agent.git
cd CalendarAssistant
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
```

3. **Install and setup Ollama**
```bash
# Download from https://ollama.com
ollama pull llama3.1
```

4. **Configure credentials**

Create a `.env` file:

Edit `.env` with your credentials:
```
THERAPY_APPOINTMENT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
THERAPY_APPOINTMENT_PASSWORD=your_password
THERAPY_APPOINTMENT_URL=https://www.therapyappointment.com
```

5. **Setup Google Calendar API**
- Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Sign in with the same Google account you use for your personal calendar.
- This is where you’ll manage access to Google APIs.

### Create a New Project

1. Click the project dropdown at the top → **New Project**.  
2. Give it a name like **MyCalendarAPI** and click **Create**.  
3. Once created, make sure it’s selected in the top bar.

### Enable the Google Calendar API

1. In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services → Library**.  
2. Search for **Google Calendar API**.  
3. Click it → **Enable**.  
4. This activates the Calendar API for your project.

### Set Up the OAuth Consent Screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**.  
2. Choose **External** (this just means it’s for any Google account, including your own).  
3. Fill in basic info:
   - **App name:** e.g., `My Calendar Reader`
   - **User support email:** your Gmail
   - **Developer contact email:** your Gmail  
4. Click **Save and Continue** through the *Scopes* and *Test Users* pages (you can leave them blank).  
5. On the Summary page, click **Back to Dashboard**.

### Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials**.  
2. Click **+ Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**.  
3. Choose **Application type → Desktop app**.  
4. Name it something like `CalendarDesktopClient`.  
5. Click **Create**.

### Download Your Client Secret File

1. You’ll now see your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.  
2. Click **Download JSON**
3. Save or rename it to `credentials.json` and place it in your project’s root folder (same place as your Python script).  
> 💡 This file is what your code uses to authenticate with your Google account.
Once you’ve done this, you’re ready to use the `credentials.json` file in your code to authenticate and read calendar events.

### Add your email to test users

1. Go to "API & Services" and then select "OAuth Consent Screen" from the left menu
2. Click "Audience" in the new tab that appears on the left
3. Scroll down to Test Users and select "Add users"
4. Type in your email and hit Save

### Publish App so your credentials last longer than 7 days

1. Go to "API & Services" and then select "OAuth Consent Screen" from the left menu
2. Click "Audience" in the new tab that appears on the left
3. Near the top of the page under "Publishing Status" click the button to publish your app

## Usage

Run the agent:
```bash
python calendar_agent.py
```

Chat naturally with the AI:
```

## Key Features Explained

### 1. AI-Powered Interaction
The LLM (Ollama) understands natural language and decides when to call functions:
- "Sync my calendar" → Calls `sync_calendars()`
- "What's on my calendar tomorrow?" → Calls `get_upcoming_events()`
- Can be extended with more functions

### 2. Browser Automation
Playwright controls a real browser to:
- Login to TherapyAppointment
- Navigate to availability settings
- Fill out forms to block times
- Handle dynamic content and JavaScript

### 3. Smart Syncing
- Only syncs time-based events (skips all-day events)
- Customizable sync window (default: 7 days ahead)
- Maintains event privacy (only blocks times, not details)

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
THERAPY_APPOINTMENT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
THERAPY_APPOINTMENT_PASSWORD=your_password
THERAPY_APPOINTMENT_URL=https://www.therapyappointment.com
```

### Customization

**Change sync window:**
```
You: Sync my calendar for the next 14 days
```

## Troubleshooting

### Ollama Issues

**"Connection refused"**
```bash
# Make sure Ollama is running
ollama serve
```

**"Model not found"**
```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

### Google Calendar Issues

**"credentials.json not found"**
- Download OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Place in project root directory

**"Permission denied"**
- Delete `token.pickle` and re-authenticate
- Make sure Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud

### Running in Debug Mode

```bash
# Playwright inspector mode
PWDEBUG=1 python calendar_agent.py

# Slow motion (see each action)
# Edit code: slow_mo=1000 in browser.launch()
```

### Adding New Functions

To add new capabilities (e.g., analytics), add to the `tools` list in `chat()`:

```python
{
    'type': 'function',
    'function': {
        'name': 'analyze_booking_trends',
        'description': 'Analyzes booking patterns over time',
        'parameters': {...}
    }
}
```

Then implement the function in the `CalendarSyncAgent` class.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** - "Show me booking trends this month"
- [ ] 🔔 **Proactive Notifications** - Alert when conflicts detected
- [ ] ⏰ **Scheduled Syncs** - Auto-sync every hour
- [ ] 📱 **Web Interface** - Replace CLI with web UI
